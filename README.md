# Description

This week my task was to write JavaScript code to analyse records. We were given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields (Date and profit/losses in $). We were tasked to calculate the total number of months in the dataset, the net total amount of profit/losses, the average of the changes in profit/losses and the greatest increase/decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period. We had to print the analysis to the console.
